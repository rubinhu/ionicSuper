    Basic Alerts are typically used to
    notify the user about new information (a change in the app, a new feature, etc), an urgent situation that requires acknowledgement,
    or as a confirmation to the user that an action was successful or not.
    <button ion-button block color="dark" (click)="doAlert()">Show Basic Alert</button> 

     Checkbox Alerts are a type
    of Confirmation Alert, but use the Checkbox component to offer several choices. They offer the user a set of options to
    choose from.
    <button ion-button block color="danger" (click)="doCheckbox()">Show Checkbox Alert</button>

     Confirmation Alerts are used
    when it is required that the user explicitly confirms a particular choice before progressing forward in the app. A common
    example of the Confirmation Alert is checking to make sure a user wants to delete or remove a contact from their address
    book.
    <button ion-button color="primary" block (click)="doConfirm()">Show Confirm Alert</button>

     Prompts offer a way to input
    data or information. Often times Prompts will be used to ask the user for a password before moving forward in an applicationâ€™s
    flow.
    <button ion-button color="secondary" block (click)="doPrompt()">Show Prompt Alert</button>

     Radio Alerts are a type of Confirmation Alert,
    but use the Radio component to offer several choices. A set of options is provided to the user, but only one option can
    be chosen.
    <button ion-button block light (click)="doRadio()">Show Radio Alert</button>
